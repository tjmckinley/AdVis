# Visualisation (the new-fangled way)

We have seen that the R base graphics system is highly flexible, and can be used to produce high-quality, bespoke animations and visualisations. However, it was a lot of work! Let's show an alternative way to produce a similar plot. We will introduce the code first, and then talk through it.

This uses the `ggplot2` package, so make sure it's loaded:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```
